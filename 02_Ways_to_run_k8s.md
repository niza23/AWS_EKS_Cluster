# 📘 Approaches to Running Kubernetes

## 1. Self-Managed Kubernetes (DIY, Anywhere)

You install Kubernetes manually on servers (physical or virtual).
This can be **on-prem (bare metal)**, **VMs**, or **cloud instances (like AWS EC2, Azure VMs, GCP Compute Engine)**.

### 🔑 Characteristics

* You manage **everything**: control plane, worker nodes, networking, security.
* Maximum flexibility but maximum complexity.

### ✅ Pros

* Full control over versions, configs, networking, CNI plugins.
* Cost savings (no managed service fees).
* Great for learning Kubernetes internals.

### ⚠️ Cons

* Time-consuming, complex.
* You handle upgrades, HA, scaling, security.
* High risk of misconfigurations.

         └──────────────────────────────┘
                        │
       You install everything manually:
  Control Plane + Worker Nodes + Networking
```

## 2. Semi-Managed (Tools like Kops, kubeadm, Rancher)

These tools help you **bootstrap and manage** clusters.
They automate installation of control plane + worker nodes, networking, and IAM setup.

Examples:

* **Kops** (popular on AWS)
* **kubeadm** (vanilla bootstrapping tool)
* **Rancher** (multi-cluster management platform)

### 🔑 Characteristics

* Faster setup than manual install.
* Still your responsibility to monitor, upgrade, secure.
* Often **infrastructure as code** (YAML configs).

### ✅ Pros

* Easier cluster setup (compared to DIY).
* Production-grade automation (HA, upgrades, TLS).
* Flexible across clouds or on-prem.

### ⚠️ Cons

* Still self-managed (not a fully managed service).
* You handle scaling, monitoring, patching.
* Requires expertise in both Kubernetes + tool.

         │   Semi-Managed Kubernetes     │
         │ (Kops / kubeadm / Rancher)    │
         └──────────────────────────────┘
                        │
         Tool automates provisioning:
       EC2/VMs + Control Plane + Workers
                        │
       You still manage upgrades, patches,
            monitoring, and security
```

## 3. Managed Kubernetes Services

You let a **cloud provider manage the control plane** for you.
Examples:

* **Amazon EKS** (AWS)
* **Google GKE** (GCP)
* **Azure AKS** (Azure)
* **Others**: DigitalOcean Kubernetes, Linode LKE, IBM, etc.

### 🔑 Characteristics

* Cloud provider runs control plane (HA, upgrades, security).
* You manage worker nodes (sometimes even those can be serverless, e.g., AWS Fargate, GKE Autopilot).
* Deep integration with cloud ecosystem (IAM, networking, logging).

### ✅ Pros

* Simplest way to run Kubernetes at scale.
* Production-ready, highly available, secure.
* No need to worry about control plane HA/patching.

### ⚠️ Cons

* Costs more (control plane + node pricing).
* Less flexibility in cluster internals.
* Some vendor lock-in (though still CNCF-certified).

         │     Managed Kubernetes        │

         └──────────────────────────────┘
                        │
     Cloud manages Control Plane (API, etcd)
                        │
         You manage worker nodes (or serverless)
                        │
         You focus on apps, not infra details
```

| Feature       | Self-Managed (DIY) | Semi-Managed (Kops, etc.) | Managed (EKS/GKE/AKS)      |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Control Plane | You install/manage | Tool installs, you manage | Cloud provider manages     |
| Worker Nodes  | You manage         | You manage                | You manage (or serverless) |
| Automation    | None (manual)      | High (bootstrap & config) | Medium (nodes automated)   |
| Complexity    | Very High          | Medium                    | Low                        |
| Cost          | Lower              | Medium                    | Higher                     |
| Best For      | Learning, custom   | DIY production clusters   | Production workloads       |

📌 **Summary**:

* **Self-Managed** → Full control, but complex.
* **Semi-Managed** → Tools automate setup, but you still own ops.
* **Managed** → Cloud handles control plane, you focus on apps.
